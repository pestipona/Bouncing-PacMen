# PacMen Exercise

![](images/PacMan1.png)

This exercise is based on the old classic game of **PacMan**. However, this project does not build the full pacMan game but just shows a feature of the game. Where the pacMan character is displayed on the screen and bounces off from one side to the other. The program also allows user interaction by allowing the user to create more PacMen that would each behave similarly but move in different directions.

This project is more about demonstrating the basic use and concepts of ```JavaScript```, ```HTML```, and ```CSS``` which are commonly used in today's **web pages** and **front-end applications**. One of the concepts used in this example is  the use of ```setTimeout``` and ```setInterval``` and ```checkPageBounds```.
